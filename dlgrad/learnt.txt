1. for dictionaries we dont have to define global 
2. to unpack a tuple and assign it to variables, we have to place it inside the brackets and add a comma
    a, b = (*c) -> a, b = (d, e)
    If we dont make it a tuple, then * will be interpreted as multiplicate and (a, b =) as first term, 
    which will throw an error.
